\title{This function performs diagnostic analysis on a fitted linear model. It checks
for outliers, leverage points, and assesses the independence of residuals.
It calculates standardized, internally, and externally studentized residuals.}
\usage{
multi_lm_diag(model_results)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_results}{A list containing the results of the model fitting function, which
must include model matrix, fitted values, residuals, sigma hat, and hat values.}
}
\value{
A list that includes diagnostic statistics and plots.
}
